### Project Description

In this mini project, I flex my web scrapping muscles and get holywood movies data from 2018 to 2022 to analyse trends.

I make use of the pythons beautiful soup package and scrap data from wikipedia website. Using the scraped data, I collected additional data from 'The Movie Database (TMDB)' website through thier API and added additional features to the scrapped data that will help me build a movie recommendation engine. At the end, I build a datapipeline that automatically fetches and preprocess movies from any given here into a suitable format and saves to disc
